# About me

Hi! I am Payal Patel, a 2nd-year Computer Science student at Northeastern University. Prior to college, I developed a deep interest in the field of robotics and how software and hardware effectively intertwine to complete tasks in real world applications. I was motivated to take programming courses to gain software skills and participate in FIRST robotics teams to gain hardware skills. I have continued to expand my knowledge in college by joining the VEXU robotics team and taking more advanced programming courses. Currently, I am applying my skills by interning at an underwater robotics research lab that gathers sonar sensor data and develops Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms to understand the underwater environment. My goal is to explore the robotics industry more by searching for co-op opportunities that support my interest in software and hardware.

My technical skills include writing code in Java, Python, SQL, ROS, and Racket for software and utilizing Computer Aided Design and 3D printing platforms for hardware. The tools that I have used are Visual Studio Code, Github, Eclipse, IntelliJ, MySQL, Numpy, Sympy, Onshape, and Solidworks. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript with React in the Northeastern Oasis club to create an interesting and practical web application with a group of peers. This Github showcases different projects I have created before and during college with some of the skills I have developed through activities and courses.
